Hi ! My name is Axel Zuber. I live in a small village to the north of Frankfurt/Main in Germany.<br/>

When i am not busy resolving the last quirks of a Kubernetes component, i enjoy hiking, sailing and restoring vintage machinery.
In this blog i will talk about Kubernetes, Micro Services, and their application. 
I have been around since CPU clock rates were measured in MHz and data transfer rates in kb/s, so you should expect the occasional historical item as well.

For the last 28 years i worked as a solution architect/lead engineer/software developer<br/>
at [Deutsche Bank](https://www.db.com/). During my tenure i used most of the platforms en-vogue in that time :
- IBM z/OS
- Bare-metal and fully virtualized servers running Unix-like OSes
- Private cloud (Red Hat Openshift)
- Google Cloud Platform

I graduated from the [Technical University of Darmstadt](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/index.en.jsp) with a degree in solid state physics in 1989.
