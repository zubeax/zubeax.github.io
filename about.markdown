My name is Axel Zuber. I live in a small village to the north of Frankfurt/Main in Germany.

For the last 28 years i worked as a solution architect/lead engineer/software developer at [Deutsche Bank](https://www.db.com/).

I graduated with a degree in solid state physics from the [University of Darmstadt](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/index.en.jsp).

If you want to go back further, check out my [LinkedIn profile]()[https://www.linkedin.com/in/axel-zuber-7497a23/].

I blog about Kubernetes, Micro Services and their application. Since i have been around since CPU clock rates have been measured in MHz, you will have to expect the occasional historical item as well.
