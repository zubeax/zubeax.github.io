My name is Axel Zuber. I live in a small village to the north of Frankfurt/Main in Germany.

For the last 28 years i worked as a solution architect/lead engineer/software developer at [Deutsche Bank](https://www.db.com/). During my tenure i used on most of the platforms en-vogue in that time :
- IBM z/OS
- Unix-like bare-metal servers
- Private cloud (Red Hat Openshift)
- Google Cloud Platform

I graduated with a degree in solid state physics from the [University of Darmstadt](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/index.en.jsp) in 1989.

I blog about Kubernetes, Micro Services and their application. Since i have been around since CPU clock rates have been measured in MHz, you will should expect the occasional historical item as well.
