## Introduction

As you probably already realized i reconfigured the blog for a new jekyll theme. It is called
[<b>Hydejack</b>](https://hydejack.com/) and i think it is pretty awesome. Besides the stylish looks Hydejack comes with some cool features.

## Migration

I took a while to climb up the learning curve, but in the end i managed. Comments are working now (again). I also refactored the blog articles to some extent to make use of the new features. Hope you like them.

## Conclusion

After this bit of reengineering i am back on track on my journey towards a basement grade Kubernetes Cluster.

Stay tuned !
