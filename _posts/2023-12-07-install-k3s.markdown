After completing the basic prerequisite tasks I am now ready to install Kubernetes on the master and client nodes.
There are a number of options for doing so :

-   k3s, a bare-metal kubernetes distribution derived from the official sources, published by Rancher
-   MicroK8s, similar to k3s, published by Canonical
-   os-specific packages for kubectl, containerd, ...

k3s seemed to be a popular choice, so i decided to go with it.
